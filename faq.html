             <h2>Do i need a collateral to secure a loan?</h2>
             <p>At LoanMart, you do not need a collateral to secure a loan regardless of the type of loan.We noticed how hard it is to secure a loan without sufficient or lack of collateral.That is why we have taken this initiative to bridge that gap. However after your loan application has been approved, you will be required to pay a small % of your loan amount as insurance to mitigate risk involved since no collateral will be collected from you.The loan insurance is refundable after your loan has been fully paid.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
             <h2>How long does it take to get approved?</h2>
             <p>Due to the high volumn of applications, there may be delays.Each applicant is emailed a decision within 2 to 3 business days after submitting an application.However, we may request for more information after submitting your application to better understand your situation and profer a solution to your needs.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
             <h2>How long will it take to receive my funds?</h2>
             <p>As soon as we confirm payment for your loan insurance, funds are approved and will be disbursed without further delay.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
             <h2>How do i receive payment?</h2>
             <p>For applicants within the united states, your approved loan will be sent via ACH, direct deposit, wire transfer or we can have a check mailed to your address.For applicants within other parts of the world, a wire transfer will be sent to your bank account.Note that for wire transfers outside the united states, it might take 2 to 5 business days to receive the funds in your bank account depending on your banking institution.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
             <h2>Do i need a business plan to get a business loan?</h2>
             <p>While other lenders might make it mandatory to have a business plan, we do not make it mandatory.However, having a formal business plan increases your chances of getting approved for a business loan.</p>
